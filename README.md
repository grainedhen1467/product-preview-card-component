## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Not certain yet, but it seems like grid is superior to flexbox when it comes to spacing out elements uniformly. While using flexbox I noticed you have to rely more on margins to space things out. Also, sizing images in a container was a pain. I learned using object-fit: cover plus 100% width and height worked, at least for me.

### Continued development

I am currently working on flexbox, grid, and responsive design. All-in-all, I'm still weak in frontend but it's fine.
